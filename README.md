#OVERVIEW
This project analyzes sales data to uncover key insights into trends, regional performance, and product sales in a Nigerian company. The project demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python, with tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
The findings from this analysis can help businesses optimize their sales strategy, improve product offerings, and target high-performing regions.

## Objectives
1. Clean and preprocess raw sales data to make it usable for analysis.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
3. Visualize key metrics such as sales trends, regional performance, and top-selling products.
4. Provide actionable insights based on the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:

- **Date**: Date of the sales transaction.
- **Region**: Region where the sales occurred.
- **Make**: Make of the car sold.
- **Model**: Model category.
- **Year**: Year car was manufactured.
- **Amount**: Amount car was sold for.
The dataset may contain missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types, which were handled during the cleaning process.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
  - Plotly (optional): For interactive visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run and document the analysis process.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Imported the raw sales dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Previewed the data and performed initial inspections.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
   - Standardized data formats (e.g., converting dates to datetime).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyzed sales trends over time using line plots.
   - Identified regional performance through bar charts.
   - Determined top-selling products and profit distributions.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

5. **Reporting Insights**:
   - Summarized key findings, including sales peaks, high-performing regions, and product trends.
